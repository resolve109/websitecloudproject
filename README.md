# websitecloudproject
personal portfolio website - used chatgpt to help with learning javascript and youtube tutorials. Chatgpt helped write the code. Purpose is to create a website and publish it using AWS - WIP until website is updated, private repo has more updated code, this is just for general collab and peer review from colleagues/friends.
